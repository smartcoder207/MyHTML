    <p>Even if conventional history ignores Olabisi Ajala, the phrase “Ajala the traveller”, a nickname in Southwest Nigeria for the footloose and the adventurous, means he would never be forgotten.

        In fact, the legendary Juju musician, Ebenezer Obey, in his 1972 hit album, “Board Members,” contributed to etching his name in Yoruba folklore when he sang memorable lines about his adventures:
        
        “Ajala travelled all over the world (2ce). Ajala travelled (2ce), Ajala travelled all over the world.”
        
        Such was the life lived by Moshood Adisa Olabisi Ajala, aka Ọlábísí Àjàlá, who toured about 87 countries on a motorcycle in the 1950s.
        
        By every inch of it, his adventure had all the trappings of glitz, showing off not just himself but also his culture as an African.
        
        In every country he visited, he donned his agbada  the Yoruba flowing gown and a cap, a combination described as “elaborately flowered robes with a felt-like head-dresses to match.”
        
        Flawed he was, as is everyone. Heroes, as the great columnist Sam Omatseye once wrote, do not come in neat packages. Neither are villains complete disasters.
        
        If Mungo Park toured the African coast to “discover” the River Niger and Ferdinand Magellan circumnavigated to prove the earth was spherical, Ajala explored the world to exhibit the African culture and the can-do élan of Nigerians.
        
        Ajala is therefore to Africa what Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, James Cook, and Marco Polo are to Europe, and Ibn Battuta al-Tanji and Zheng He to Asia.
        
        His motorcycle was his compass which he used to cross borders and challenge the brutality of racial intolerance.</p>


    <h2>Leaving Nigeria</h2>
<p>Aged 18, <br> </br> he travelled to the United States to study pre-medicine at the University of Chicago, <br> </br> becoming the first black student in the Delta Upsilon Pi ‘fratority’, <br> </br> a co-educational Greek-letter organisation.</p>
